WikiQuiz
========

WikiQuiz is a learning game which creates questions around a topic you specify.
It utilises MediaWiki's API to request articles based on a topic, then
parses the page and finds facts it can reliably understand, which it then uses
to create simple quiz-style questions with multiple-choice answers.
